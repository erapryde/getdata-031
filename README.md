#Hi, my name is EraPryde 
###I am a course participant of August 3, 2015 offering of Getting and Cleaning Data.<br>
Before we beign, I must presume certain things regarding the directory hierarchy as well as Operating System, R version. Oh, you will also need to download, install and load the dplyr package too. <br>
Use these commands<br>
>>install.packages("dplyr")<br>
>>library(dplyr)<br>
