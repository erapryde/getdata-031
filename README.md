run-analysis.R must be placed at the same hierarchy as the UCI HAR Dataset folder, with the datasets distributed in the same manner you have downloaded it. The following picture describes the file/folder hierarchy.<br>
run_analysis.R also assumes that you have a Windows system as setwd() commands are different for Mac OS.<br>
You must also have installed and loaded dplyr package. You can do so by
>>install.packages("dplyr")<br>
>>library(dplyr)<br>
